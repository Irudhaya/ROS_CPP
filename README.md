# ROS_CPP
Basics of using C++ with ROS. The files that are in this repository are created during my learning phase of coding ROS based executables with C++. The programming tasks are provided by the [**free course**](https://www.theconstructsim.com/robotigniteacademy_learnros/ros-courses-library/cpp-for-robotics/) offered by [**ROBOT IGNITE ACADEMY**](https://www.theconstructsim.com/).


## Lesson 1:

* [*name.cpp*](https://github.com/Irudhaya/ROS_CPP/blob/learning/lessons/class_files/cpp_course_repo/utilities/name.cpp)  c++ code that prints "Hello World" to the console.
* [*unit1.cpp*]() c++ code that makes the robot to move and prints the position of the robot in Gazebo
* [*unit1_exercise.cpp*] ros c++ code that makes the robot to move and prints the position of the robot
in gazebo at two instants.
